# Data and Products of the Global Ice-Ocean Prediction System (GIOPS)

The Global Ice-Ocean Prediction System (GIOPS) produces global sea ice and ocean analyses and 10 day forecasts daily. This product contains time-mean sea ice and ocean forecast fields interpolated to two grids. One of the grids is a 0.2° resolution regular latitude-longitude grid covering the global ocean (north of 80° S). The other grid is in north-polar stereographic projection with a 5-km spacing at the standard parallel 60° N and covers the Arctic Ocean and the neighbouring sub-polar seas. Data is available for 50 depths. The data files are in netCDF format and comply with the Climate and Forecast Conventions. 

## Access

### How to access the data

These data are available on the data server services [MSC Datamart](../../msc-datamart/readme_en.md) and the web services [MSC GeoMet](../../msc-geomet/readme_en.md) respectively:

* [NetCDF data available on the MSC Datamart](readme_giops-datamart_en.md) 
* [Data available via geospatial web services GeoMet-Weather](../../msc-geomet/readme_en.md)

An [overview and examples to access and use the Meteorological Service of Canada's open data](../../usage/readme_en.md) is available.

### Licence

The [End-User Licence for Environment and Climate Change Canada's Data Servers](../../licence/readme_en.md) specifies the conditions of use of these data.
