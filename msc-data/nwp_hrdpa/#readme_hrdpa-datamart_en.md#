# High Resolution Deterministic Precipitation Analysis (HRDPA) Data in GRIB2 Format

This page describes the [High Resolution Deterministic Precipitation Analysis](./readme_hrdpa-datamart_en.md) data available in GRIB2 format.

## Data location

MSC Datamart data can be [automatically retrieved with the Advanced Message Queuing Protocol (AMQP)](../../msc-datamart/amqp_en.md) as soon as they become available. An [overview and examples to access and use the Meteorological Service of Canada's open data](../../usage/readme_en.md) is also available.

The data is available using the HTTPS protocol and resides in a directory that is plainly accessible to a web browser. Visiting that directory with an interactive browser will yield a raw listing of links, each link being a downloadable GRIB2 file.

The data can be accessed at the following URLs :


* [https://dd.weather.gc.ca/analysis/precip/hrdpa/grib2/polar_stereographic/{HH}](https://dd.weather.gc.ca/analysis/precip/hrdpa/grib2/polar_stereographic)

where :

* __polar_stereographic__ :  Grid projection
* __HH__ :  Accumulation period in hours: 06 or 24 

A history of 30 days is maintained in this directory.

## Grid specifications

Table lists the values of parameters of the polar-stereographic grid.

| Parameter | Value |
| ------ | ------ |
| ni | 2500 |
| nj | 1222 | 
| resolution at 60° N | 2.5 km |
| coordinates of the first grid point | 42.2504° N  131.0928° W | 
| grid orientation (with respect to j axis) | -115.0° |

## File name nomenclature 

NOTE : ALL HOURS ARE IN UTC.

The files have the following nomenclature:

CMC_HRDPA_APCP-TotalPrecipAmount-HHMMcutoff_SFC_0_ps2.5km_YYYYMMDDHH_000.grib2

where :

* __CMC__ : Data is produced by the Canadian Meteorological Centre (Constant string)
* __HRDPA__ : High Resolution Deterministic Precipitation Analysis (Constant string)
* __APCP__ : Analysis of Precipitation (Constant string)
* __TotalPrecipAmountPeriod__ : Total precipitation amount over a period of time in number of hours (006 or 024)
* __HHMMcutoff__ : Observation cuttoff time in number of hours and minutes after valid time. (0100cutoff or 0700cutoff)
* __SFC_0__ : Level type is Surface and level value is 0 (Constant string)
* __ps2.5km__ : Projection type is Polar-Stereographic and the resolution is 2.5 km (Constant string)
* __YYYYMMDDHH__ : Analysis valid time in UTC. YYYY=Year, MM=Month, DD=Day, HH=Hour (ex: 2018020912)
* __000__ : The projection time in number of hours. Always 000 for an analysis product (Constant string)

Example :

CMC_HRDPA_APCP-006-0100cutoff_SFC_0_ps2.5km_2018020912_000.grib2

This file originates from the Canadian Meteorological Center (CMC) and contains data of the High Resolution Deterministic Precipitation Analysis (HRDPA). This is a precipitation analysis (APCP) of 6 hour amounts (006) where the accumulation period goes from 2018020906 to 2018020912. It is considered preliminary because observations have been collected up to 2018020913, which is 1 hour after valid time (0100cutoff). The data is on a polar-stereographic grid at a resolution of 2.5 km (ps2.5km). The valid time of the analysis is 2018020912_000 and the suffix _000 means that the projection time in the future is null, which is always the case for an analysis. The data is encoded in GRIB2 format (.grib2).

Note that a second variable is also included in this file and it is the confidence index for the analysis (CFIA).

## About the No-data mask

A mask called "No-data" has been added to our GRIB2 encoding process in order to better represent the areas where data are unavailable. This mask only concerns a few grid points with no data, always the same ones, located at the edge of the domain. Note that this mask has no negative effect on the product quality.
