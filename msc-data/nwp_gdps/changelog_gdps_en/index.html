<h3 id="addition-of-iasi-observations-from-metop-b1-to-the-operational-data-of-the-gdps">Addition of IASI observations from METOP-B/1 to the operational data of the GDPS</h3>
<p>On April 30th, 2014, starting with the 0600 UTC trial-field run of the Global Deterministic Prediction System (GDPS), the Canadian Meteorological Centre (CMC) of Environment Canada added radiance observations from the IASI instrument aboard the METOP-B/1 satellite to the operational data assimilation system. IASI is the last of the instruments on-board the METOP-B/1 satellite to be included in the operational data assimilation systems.</p>
<p>Motivation for the incorporation of IASI observations from METOP-B/1 in the operational data of the GDPS:</p>
<ul>
<li>Although IASI data from METOP-A/2 will continue to be assimilated into our forecast systems, METOP-B/1 is now the operational METOP satellite of the EUMETSAT agency. The two satellites METOP-A/2 and METOP-B/1 have similar trajectories, but offset by a half-orbit, so the addition of METOP-B/1 IASI data will almost double the number of IASI data assimilated. Furthermore, these new data add robustness to the data assimilation system in the event of a failure of the IASI instrument on-board either METOP-A/2 or METOP-B/1.</li>
</ul>
<p>Following this change, the version of the GDPS system is changed from 3.1.0 to 3.1.1.

<p>On Thursday November 7 2013, additional satellite data was added to the operational data assimilation system of the Global Deterministic Prediction System (GDPS). Changes include the following: additional CSR (Clear Sky Radiance) radiances from MeteoSat10, additional ATOVS radiances from Metop-B and additional AVHRR polar winds from Metop-B.</p>
<p>Along with the addition of satellite data, there were also other adjustments made to the systems. There was an update of the spectroscopic coefficient files used by the RTTOV radiative transfer model for computing the simulated observations (the 6-hour "P"rognosis portion of the Observations-Prognosis (O-P) of the AMSUB and MHS instruments onboard all satellites. These new coefficients labelled as "Newstyle" do not separate out water vapor transmittances into line absorption and continuum absorption. The impact on the results are neutral.</p>
<p>As a result of all of the above changes installed in this implementation, the GDPS operational system becomes version 3.1.0.</p>

<p>On Wednesday February 13 2013, starting with the 1200 UTC run, the Canadian Meteorological Centre (CMC) will implement version 3.0.0 of the Global Deterministic Prediction System (GDPS).</p>
<p>This major upgrade includes a new version to the GEM model, important changes to the 4D-Var data assimilation scheme and to some of the model's physics schemes.</p>
<p>In this version, the grid of the model is also increased to a resolution of 25km. Also, this version now uses staggered hybrid vertical coordinates. <a href="https://collaboration.cmc.ec.gc.ca/cmc/cmoi/product_guide/docs/lib/op_systems/doc_opchanges/HybridVerticalCoordinateDefinitions_20130213.pdf">Information on staggered hybrid vertical coordinates</a> on the topic along with <a href="https://collaboration.cmc.ec.gc.ca/cmc/cmoi/product_guide/docs/lib/op_systems/doc_opchanges/VerticalCoordinatesDiagram_afsysed_20130213.jpg">a diagram</a>.</p>
<p>Objective Scores show improvements in the forecasts with most metrics throughout most of the atmosphere, in particular over North America in winter. A subjective evaluation by operational meteorologists confirmed those improvements.</p>
<p>As part of this implementation the cutoff time for collecting observations has been reduced and is now [00,12]Z+3:05</p>
<p>Changes were also brought to the Regional Determnistic Prediction System (RDPS) to harmonize it with GDPS-3.0.0, and the RDPS forecasts are also improved. As a result of these RDPS adjustments, the version of RDPS is now 3.1.0</p>

<h3 id="improvements-to-the-global-deterministic-prediction-system-gdps-v-220-of-the-canadian-meteorological-centre">Improvements to the Global Deterministic Prediction System (GDPS v 2.2.0) of the Canadian Meteorological Centre</h3>
<p>Starting on November 16 2011 at 06 UTC, the Canadian Meteorological Centre (CMC) will implement changes to the global and regional data assimilation systems by incorporating additional satellite data and by introducing a higher quality analysis of the sea surface temperature.</p>
<p>Here is an overview of changes involving global data assimilation system:</p>
<p>A. New Satellite Data: The following satellite data will be incorporated in the global and regional data assimilation systems:
- Sixty-two (62) infrared channels from the IASI instrument on board the METOP satellite.
- Seven (7) microwave channels from the SSM/IS instrument on board the DMSP F16 satellite.
- One (1) water vapor channel from the GOES-W, METSAT-1R and both METEOSAT satellites.
- A restriction to the infrared channels of the AIRS instrument in the polar regions will be removed.
- The horizontal thinning of all satellite radiance data, currently done at 250 km (except 200 km for SSM/I) will be reduced to 150 km, therefore adding much more satellite data to the systems.</p>
<p>B. Other Assimilation Changes:
- Moisture observations measured from properly equipped aircraft (AMDAR) will be assimilated.
- A new satellite data bias correction scheme will replace the current one. The main impact is the reduction of the time period to compute the bias corrections from 15 to 7 days. the same code is used for all radiance data.
- A modified version of the RTTOV radiative transfer code will be used for satellite radiance data.
- Also, a new sea surface temperature analysis on a grid of 0.20 degrees resolution will be used now by both global and regional systems.</p>
<p>As a consequence of these changes, the amount of observational data assimilated in the global data assimilation system will increase from about 1.9 million to 4.2 million pieces of information per day.</p>
<p>All of the above changes were combined and tested extensively during winter and summer seasons, including a parallel run of the global system. </p>
