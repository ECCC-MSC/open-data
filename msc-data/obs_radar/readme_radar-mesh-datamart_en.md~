# S-Band volume scans data in ODIM_H5 format

Raw S-band radar files are in Leonardo Rainbow version 5 (RB5) format. The S-band radar scan strategy is based on PVOL6, which stands for “six-minute polar volume”. The acronym PVOL has its origin in the ODIM standard currently used in Europe and Australia. The PVOL6S consists of 17 sweeps that are acquired sequentially, in descending order (top-down), such that the lowest sweep is collected closest to the nominal time of the volume. All sweeps are Doppler and dual-polarized. Elevation angles range between 0.4° and 24.4° and the radar beam width is 0.9°. The lowest 6 sweeps are dual Pulse Repetition Frequency (PRF) (600/450 Hz), have an azimuthal resolution of 0.5° and 0.5 km range step, and extend to 240 km range. The remaining elevations are single PRF (600-1200 Hz) with 1° azimuth resolution and 0.5 km range step. Maximum range for these elevations are configured to enable vertical sampling up to 20 km altitude. In terms of timing, PVOL6S is collected regularly every six minutes, starting just after minute 0. 

## Data Address 

MSC Datamart data can be [automatically retrieved with the Advanced Message Queuing Protocol (AMQP)](.../.../msc-datamart/amqp_en.md) as it becomes available. An [overview and examples to access and use Meteorological Service of Canada's open data](../../usage/readme_en.md) is also available.

The data is available via the HTTPS protocol. It is possible to access it with a standard browser. In this case, we obtain a list of links giving access to an hdf5 file.

The data are available at the address :

[https://hpfx.collab.science.gc.ca/{YYYYMMDD}/WXO-DD/radar/volume-scans/{RADAR_ID}](https://hpfx.collab.science.gc.ca/)

where:

* __YYYYMMDD__ : Year, month and day
* __RADAR_ID__ : Radar identifier, a 5 letter code in capital letters (see list below).

A history of several weeks is kept in this directory.

__Note__: 

* A [list of radar sites](https://collaboration.cmc.ec.gc.ca/cmc/cmos/public_doc/msc-data/obs_radar/radars_list.pdf) is available. This list will be updated regularly.

## Nomenclature of file names

Files follow the following nomenclature:

`{YYYYYMMDD}T{HHmm}Z_MSC_Radar-VolumeScans_{RADAR_ID}.hdf5`

where:

* __YYYYMMDD__ : Year, month and day of the data emission
* __T__ : Time delimiter according to ISO8601 standards
* __HHmm__: Hour and minute at which the data is sent
* __Z__: Time zone (UTC time)
* __MSC__: Constant string for Meteorological Service of Canada, the data source
* __Radar-VolumeScans__ : Constant string indicating that the data contains radar volume scans
* __RADAR_ID__ : 5-letter uppercase code representing the radar identifier
* __hdf5__ : Constant string indicating that the format is HDF5

Example:

* 20230511T0036Z_MSC_Radar-VolumeScans_CASBV.hdf5

## File contents

The volume scans, also called raw data, are generated in Leonardo's native RAINBOW format (*). During a 6-minute cycle, we distribute 10 PVOL6S.vol files for the full volume files, i.e. 17 scans for each of the following 10 parameters:

* dBuZ: Uncorrected horizontally-polarized radar reflectivity factor
* dBZ: Corrected horizontally-polarized radar reflectivity factor
* V: Horizontally-polarized radial wind velocity
* W: Horizontally-polarized spectral width
* uPhiDP: Differential phase HV
* PHIDP: Corrected differential phase HV
* ZDR: Log differential reflectivity (H/V)
* RhoHV: Correlation coefficient between H and V
* SQI: Signal quality index H
* KDP: Specific differential phase

NOTE: The GTS (Global Telecommunication System) header contains the following information:  

```
SDCN01 CWAO
ODIM_H5 <Radar_ID> <DDHHmm>
```
 
The second line contains specific information for each radar such : `product_type`, `radar_id` and `daytime`.
