# High Resolution Deterministic Prediction System (HRDPS) data in GRIB2 format

The [High Resolution Deterministic Prediction System or HRDPS](readme_hrdps_en.md) is a set of nested limited-area model (LAM) forecast grids from the non-hydrostatic version of the Global Environmental Multiscale (GEM) model with a 2.5 km horizontal grid spacing for the inner domain over one main Pan-Canadian region and a northern region over the Arctic archipelago and Greenland. The pilot model of the HRDPS is the Regional Deterministic Prediction System or RDPS (GEM Regional model). The HRDPS is operational except the northern domain which remains experimental. The fields in the HRDPS high resolution GRIB2 dataset are made available four times a day for the Pan-Canadian domain for a 48 hour forecast period (except the northern domain).

Users who will benefit most from using these data are those for whom a detailed forecast of surface temperatures and winds is important. Especially during the change of seasons and in wintertime when rapid changes in temperature and winds cause phase transitions of precipitation (freezing rain to snow to rain for example), 2.5 km forecasts could add much value. Also in the case of short-term forecasts in the presence of complex terrain or along shores, the influence of changes in altitude, topography and nature of the terrain will be better described for phenomena at this scale (lake or sea breezes, local valley flows, phase changes, etc.). Even over less rugged terrain, or over water away from shore, these more precise forecasts could be useful, repeatedly over a long period. As well, for hydrological forecasts on smaller basins, the HRDPS should be considered.

As part of a modernization plan of the Meteorological Service of Canada (MSC), coherent [weather elements on the grid](https://collaboration.cmc.ec.gc.ca/cmc/cmoi/product_guide/docs/tech_notes/technote_weong-hrdps_e.pdf) ("WEonG"), merging raw model outputs and post-processed with various diagnostic approaches, are also available to serve the different forecasting programs (public, marine, aviation, air quality, etc.).  Hourly concepts are produced from different algorithms using outputs from the pan-Canadian HRDPS. These data are available on a lat-lon rotated grid. 

## Data location

MSC Datamart data can be [automatically retrieved with the Advanced Message Queuing Protocol (AMQP)](../../msc-datamart/amqp_en.md) as soon as they become available. An [overview and examples to access and use the Meteorological Service of Canada's open data](../../usage/readme_en.md) is also available.

The data is available using the HTTPS protocol and resides in a directory that is plainly accessible to a web browser. Visiting that directory with an interactive browser will yield a raw listing of links, each link being a downloadable GRIB2 file.

The data can be accessed at the following URLs:

* Continental domain: [https://dd.weather.gc.ca/model_hrdps/continental/{res}/{HH}/{hhh}/](https://dd.weather.gc.ca/model_hrdps/continental)
* North domain (experimental): [https://dd.weather.gc.ca/model_hrdps/north/grib2/{HH}/{hhh}/](https://dd.weather.gc.ca/model_hrdps/north/grib2)

where :

* __res__ : Horizontal resolution [2.5km]
* __HH__ : Model run start, in UTC [00, 06, 12, 18], except the North domain [00, 12]
* __hhh__ : Forecast hour [000, 001, 002, ..., 048]

A 24-hour history is stored in this directory.

Note: Some weather element of the grid algorithms ("WEonG") need variable values at `t-1`, in order to standardize the data supply, the forecast times start at 001h.
