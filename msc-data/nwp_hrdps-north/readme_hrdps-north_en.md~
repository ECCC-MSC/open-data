# Data and Products of the experimental High Resolution Deterministic Prediction System North

The High Resolution Deterministic Prediction System North (HRDPS-North) is an experimental forecast system based on a limited-area (LAM) configuration of the Global Environmental Multiscale model (GEM). It covers the entire Arctic basin and Hudson Bay. The horizontal grid spacing is approximately 3.0 km with 2250 x 1850 grid points and 62 vertical levels with a SLEVE coordinate. The lowest momentum level is at an altitude of approximately 40 m. The HRDPS 3-km Nord is piloted by ECCC’s Global Deterministic Prediction System (GDPS), which provides initial and lateral boundary conditions for the atmospheric fields. The initial hydrometeor fields are recycled from the 12-h forecast of the previous HRDPS Nord integration. The ocean-ice surface fields for sea ice and temperature are provided by the Regional Ice Ocean Prediction System (RIOPS). The HRDPS Nord runs twice per day and is initialized at 00 and 12 UTC respectively with 48-h integration.

## Access

### How to access the data
