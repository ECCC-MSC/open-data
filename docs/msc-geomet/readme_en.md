# MSC GeoMet

The MSC GeoMet platform provides public access to the Meteorological Service of Canada (MSC) and Environment and Climate Change Canada (ECCC) data via interoperable web services and application programming interfaces (API). Through open standards, users can freely and quickly access thousands of real-time and archived weather, climate and water datasets and products and integrate them in their domain-specific applications and decision support systems. Users can build mobile apps, create interactive web maps, and display and animate MSC data in desktop software. MSC GeoMet also enables on demand raw data clipping and reprojection, on demand format conversion and custom visualization.

## Services

Access to the MSC GeoMet services is anonymous and free of charge. These services must be accessed with software that supports geospatial web services.

The MSC GeoMet Platform consists in the following services:

## Available OGC standards

Web services are protocols designed to support machine to machine interaction over a network, and are typically utilized in a client/server computing environment made available through programmatic access, associated tools and applications.

The MSC GeoMet web services adhere to open standards ratified by the [Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC)](https://www.opengeospatial.org/), and the [International Organization for Standardization (ISO)](https://www.isotc211.org/) which enable interoperability and thus make data easy to discover, access, visualize and integrate. OGC and ISO standards play an important role in [WMO Information System](https://public.wmo.int/en) and are supported by numerous off the shelf open source or commercial tools.

The following OGC web services are supported by MSC GeoMet:
