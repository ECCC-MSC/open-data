    "# Use Case: Retrieving and Displaying Hydrometric Data\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Hydrometric data from the Meteorological Service of Canada (MSC), Environment and Climate Change Canada (ECCC) can be easily accessed via [GeoMet-OGC-API](https://api.weather.gc.ca/). The [OGC API - Features](https://eccc-msc.github.io/open-data/msc-geomet/web-services_en/#ogc-api-features) web services available in GeoMet-OGC-API offer the capability to query vector geospatial data and retrieve it in a GeoJSON format. The GeoJSON output file can then be used for display or further data processing. This use case will show you how you can:\n",
    "* Query and retrieve vector geospatial data from GeoMet-OGC-API with [Python](https://www.python.org/)\n",
    "* Display time series data in graphic and tabular format\n",
    "* Create an interactive map to display geospatial data\n",
    "\n",
    "This use case comes in two different versions. This version is conceived to be used in a Jupyter Notebook and includes more interactive features like dropdown menus to choose the value of the variables, an interactive plot with a variety of controls and an interactive map based on Leaflet. As some libraries used in this version like ipywidgets are not conceived to be used outside of a Jupyter Notebook, the [other version of this use case](../use-case_oafeat-script_en/) presents a script that is designed to be run in a terminal or an IDE.\n",
    "\n",
    "To run the entire notebook, click on the ⏩️ symbol or select the Cell -> Run All option in the menu bar.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Creation of a tool to monitor water levels\n",
    "\n",
    "Cathy runs a boat tours and water sports company in Chilliwack, British-Columbia. She would like to track the water levels of a few hydrometric stations near her city to guide the management of the company's activities. She would like to have:\n",
    "* The daily mean water levels of a three months period for all hydrometric stations located within 100 km of the city of Chilliwack\n",
    "* Graphic and tabular views that present the daily mean water levels of that three months period\n",
    "* An interactive map that displays the hydrometric stations located within 100 km of the city of Chilliwack and the most recent daily mean water level of these stations in the determined time period\n",
    "\n",
    "To achieve this, the first step is to import the necessary Python modules and to select the desired request parameters."

    "Cathy has now a good overview of the water levels of the rivers and lakes near her. This information will help her plan her boat tours and water sports company activities. After completing this use case, you should be able to use Python to retrieve and process geospatial data from GeoMet-OGC-API and to display data in different interactive formats (plot, table and map). This use case can be adapted to fit your needs by changing the parameters or modifying the data processing steps."
