# Climate Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI) data in NetCDF format

[SPEI data](readme_spei_en.md) in NetCDF format, a climate index used to assess the influence of climate change on drought.

## Data location

MSC Datamart data can be [automatically retrieved with the Advanced Message Queuing Protocol (AMQP)](../../msc-datamart/amqp_en.md) as soon as they become available. An [overview and examples to access and use the Meteorological Service of Canada's open data](../../usage/readme_en.md) is also available.

The data is available via the HTTPS protocol. It is possible to access it with a standard browser. In this case, we obtain a list of links giving access to a NetCDF file.

The data can be accessed at the following URLs :

* [https://dd.weather.gc.ca/today/climate/spei/netcdf/historical/{[SPEI-1, SPEI-3, SPEI-12]}](https://dd.weather.gc.ca/today/climate/spei/netcdf/historical)
* [https://dd.weather.gc.ca/today/climate/spei/netcdf/scenarios/{[RCP2.6,RCP4.5,RCP8.5]}/{[SPEI-1, SPEI-3, SPEI-12]}](https://dd.weather.gc.ca/today/climate/spei/netcdf/scenarios)

where :

* __historical__ : Historical simulations from 1900 to 2005 for the Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index. SPEI-1 corresponds to SPEI of one month; SPEI-3 corresponds to SPEI of one month and the previous 2 months, and SPEI-12 corresponds to SPEI of one month and the previous 11 months.   
* __scenarios__ : Refers to different emission scenarios [RCP2.6, RCP4.5,RCP8.5] from 2006 to 2100. 

## File name nomenclature 

File names have the form :

* CMIP5_hist_TemporalResolution_Value_ProjectionResolution_Variable_pctlPP.nc
* CMIP5_rcpx.y_TemporalResolution_Value_ProjectionResolution_Variable_pctlPP.nc

where :

* __CMIP5__ : Constant string indicating Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase5 global climate model ensemble datasets.
* __hist__ : Constant string indicating historical simulations.
* __rcpx.y__ : Type of Representative Concentration Pathways (emission scenarios), taking one of the values : [rcp2.6, rcp4.5, rcp8.5].
* __TemporalResolution__ : Time period, taking one of the values [SPEI-1, SPEI-3, SPEI-12]. SPEI-1 corresponds to SPEI of one month; SPEI-3 corresponds to SPEI of one month and the previous 2 months, and SPEI-12 corresponds to SPEI of one month and the previous 11 months. 
* __Value__ : Values category representing time period of the dataset, taking one of these two values : [2006-2100] for the scenatios and [1900-2005] for the historical simulations.
* __Projection__ : Grid mapping (projection) taking the value : [latlon]
* __Resolution__ : Grid resolution taking one of the values : [1x1]; 1 stands for 1-degree resolution in both the latitudinal and longitudinal directions.
* __Variable__ : Name of variable available in the file: Always [SPEI] which means 'Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index'.
* __PctlPP__ : Ensemble percentile number, taking one of the values : [pctl25, pctl50, pctl75]; pctl25 stands for the 25th percentile of the ensemble; pctl50 stands for the 50th percentile, also referred to as the median, of the ensemble; pctl75 stands for the 75th percentile of the ensemble.
* __nc__ : Constant string indicating the NetCDF format.

Examples :

* CMIP5_rcp8.5_SPEI-12_2006-2100_latlon1x1_SPEI_pctl50.nc

The file represents the 50th percentile of the Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index of one month and the previous 11 months over the period of 2006-2100, for the scenario rcp8.5.
