# Data and products of the Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI)  

Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI) calculated using global climate model projections from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) are provided. SPEI is a multiscalar index frequently used to quantify drought and is based on a climate water balance.
