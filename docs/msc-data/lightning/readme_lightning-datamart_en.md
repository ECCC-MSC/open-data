# Lightning density data

This page describes the [lightning](readme_lightning_en.md) data available in GeoTIFF format via the MSC Datamart.

## Data location

MSC Datamart data can be [automatically retrieved with the Advanced Message Queuing Protocol (AMQP)](../../msc-datamart/amqp_en.md) as soon as they become available. An [overview and examples to access and use the Meteorological Service of Canada's open data](../../usage/readme_en.md) is also available.

The data is available via the HTTPS protocol. It is possible to access it with a standard browser. In this case, we obtain a list of links giving access to a GeoTIFF file.

Lightning data are available at the following address:

[https://dd.weather.gc.ca/today/lightning](https://dd.weather.gc.ca/today/lightning/)


## Filename nomenclature

The files have the following nomenclature:

`{YYYYMMDD}T{HHmm}Z_MSC_Lightning_2.5km.tif`

where:

* __YYYYMMDD__ : Year, month and day of data emission
* __T__ : Time delimiter according to ISO8601 norms
* __HHmm__ : Hour and minute when data are produced
* __Z__ : Time zone (UTC hour)
* __MSC__ : Constant string indicating that the data is from the Meteorological Service of Canada (MSC)
* __Lightning__ : Constant string indicating that data contain observed flash density (km-2.min-1)
