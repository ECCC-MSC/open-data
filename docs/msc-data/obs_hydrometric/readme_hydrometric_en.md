# Hydrometric observations data

__Real-time hydrometric data__

Real-time water level and flow (discharge) data collected at over 2100 hydrometric stations across Canada (last 30 days). 
 
__Historical hydrometric data__

Historical hydrometric data are standardized water resource data and information. They are collected, interpreted and disseminated by the National Hydrological Services (NHS) in partnership with the provinces, territories and other agencies through the National Hydrometric Program. These data sets include daily mean, monthly mean, annual maximum and minimum daily mean and instantaneous peak water level and discharge information for over 2700 active and 5100 discontinued hydrometric monitoring stations across Canada.

__Hydrometric monitoring stations__

A station is a site on a river or lake where water quantity (water level and flow) are collected and recorded.
