# Climate scenarios datasets based on an ensemble of global climate model projections from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) in NetCDF format

Statistically downscaled multi-model ensembles of modelled output and projected changes are available for historical simulations and three emission scenarios, RCP2.6, RCP4.5, RCP8.5, at a 10km resolution.  Projected changes are expressed as anomalies with respect to the reference period of 1986-2005.

## Data location

MSC Datamart data can be [automatically retrieved with the Advanced Message Queuing Protocol (AMQP)](../../msc-datamart/amqp_en.md) as soon as they become available. An [overview and examples to access and use the Meteorological Service of Canada's open data](../../usage/readme_en.md) is also available.

The data is available via the HTTPS protocol. It is possible to access it with a standard browser. In this case, we obtain a list of links giving access to a NetCDF file.

The data can be accessed at the following URLs :

where :

* __historical__ : Historical simulations from 1950-2005
* __scenarios__ : Refers to different emission scenarios [RCP2.6, RCP4.5,RCP8.5] from 2006-2100

The file represents the 50th percentile of the statistically downscaled multi-model ensemble of projected relative changes in total precipitation (i.e., anomalies) averaged for 2021-2040 under the emission scenario of RCP4.5, with respect to the reference period of 1986-2005, in winter (3 month average across December, January, February), expressed as percentage change. The bands in the NetCDF file are yearly time steps.
