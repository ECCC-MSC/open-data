# Changes to the Operational Services of the Canadian Meteorological Centre (CMC)

## Tuesday June 28, 2022

### New High Performance Computing Infrastructure

A major project to migrate to a new supercomputing infrastructure employed by the Meteorological Service of Canada was completed on June 28, 2022. This successful migration was the result of a joint, sustained effort over several months by experts at the Canadian Meteorological Centre, Science and Technology Directorate, and Shared Services Canada.

Over the coming years, this important upgrade will permit further technological transfers from Research and Development into Operations, supporting the continuous improvement of the meteorological and environmental forecast services offered to Canadians and to other federal and provincial government agencies, users, and partners.

The official note announcing the migration is available at [this link](https://dd.weather.gc.ca/doc/genots/2022/06/27/NOCN03_CWAO_271857___28531).

### New High Performance Computing Infrastructure

A major project to migrate to a new supercomputing infrastructure employed by the Meteorological Service of Canada was completed on January 21, 2020. This successful migration was the result of a joint, sustained effort over several months by experts at the Canadian Meteorological Centre, Science and Technology Directorate, and Shared Services Canada.

Over the coming years, this important upgrade will permit further technological transfers from Research and Development into Operations, supporting the continuous improvement of the meteorological and environmental forecast services offered to Canadians and to other federal and provincial government agencies, users, and partners.

## Thursday June 7, 2018

### Replacement of the GOES-13 satellite by GOES-16 and Meteosat-10 satellite by Meteosat-11

On Thursday June 7, 2018, starting with the 1200 UTC run, the Canadian Meteorological Centre (CMC) of the Meteorological Service of Canada (MSC) implemented an update to version 6.0.0 of the Global Deterministic Prediction System (GDPS), version 4.3.0 of the Global Ensemble Prediction System (GEPS) and version 5.1.0 of the Regional Deterministic Prediction System (RDPS).

Only the data assimilation component was modified to include the following observations:

* Replacement of AMV (Atmospheric Motion Vector) observations from the GOES-13* satellite by those from GOES-16 in the three systems GDPS, GEPS and RDPS;
* Replacement of CSR (Clear Sky Radiance) observations from the Meteosat-10** satellite by those from Meteosat-11 in the GDPS and RDPS systems;

'* The distribution of AMV observations from GOES-13 ended permanently beginning January 8, 2018.

** Meteosat-11 replaced Meteosat-10 on February 20 2018, but the CSR observations from Meteosat-11 were not assimilated between February 20 and June 7 2018.

A copy of the official note announcing the implementation of these changes is available [at this link]().

## Thursday March 1, 2018

### Replacement of the AMV observations from Meteosat-10 by Meteosat-11

On Thursday March 1st, 2018, starting with the 1200 UTC run, the Canadian Meteorological Centre (CMC) of the Meteorological Service of Canada (MSC) implemented an update to version 6.0.0 of the Global Deterministic Prediction System (GDPS), version 4.3.0 of the Global Ensemble Prediction System (GEPS) and version 5.1.0 of the Regional Deterministic Prediction System (RDPS).

Only the data assimilation component was modified to include the following observations:

* Replacement of AMV (Atmospheric Motion Vector) observations from the Meteosat-10 satellite by those from Meteosat-11 in the three systems GDPS, GEPS and RDPS.

## Wednesday September 6, 2017

### New High Performance Computing Infrastructure

A major project to migrate to a new supercomputing infrastructure employed by the Meteorological Service of Canada was successfully completed on September 6, 2017. This migration was the result of a joint, sustained effort over several months by experts at the Canadian Meteorological Centre, Science and Technology Directorate, and Shared Services Canada.

Our high-performance computing capacity has now attained the petaflop scale (1015 flops), a level which is comparable to that of the other leading meteorological centres around the world. Over the coming years, this major upgrade will allow further technological transfers from Research and Development into Operations, supporting the continuous improvement of the meteorological and environmental forecast services offered to Canadians and to other federal and provincial government agencies, users, and partners.

The official note announcing the migration is available at [this link](https://dd.meteo.gc.ca/doc/genots/2017/08/31/NOCN03_CWAO_312003___11256).

## Wednesday March 16, 2016

### Replacement of MTSAT-2 by Himawari-8 plus addition of AMV from NPP and ISS-RapidScat

On Wednesday March 16th 2016, starting with the 1200 UTC run, the Canadian Meteorological Centre (CMC) of the Meteorological Service of Canada (MSC) will proceed with an operational implementation of version 5.1.0 of the Global Deterministic Prediction System (GDPS), version 4.2.0 of the Global Ensemble Prediction System (GEPS) and version 4.2.0 of the Regional Deterministic Prediction System (RDPS).

Only the data assimilation component was modified to include the following observations:

* Replacement of AMV (Atmospheric Motion Vector) and CSR (Clear Sky Radiance) observations from the Japanese satellite MTSAT-2 by those from Himawari-8 in the GDPS and RDPS. Since CSR data are not assimilated in GEPS, only the AMV data were replaced in this system;
* Addition of AMV data from the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) instrument on board the SUOMI National Polar-orbiting Partnership (NPP) satellite in the three systems GDPS, GEPS and RDPS;
* Addition of marine winds from the RapidScat Scatterometer mounted on the International Space Station (ISS) in the three systems GDPS, GEPS and RDPS.
* Regarding the CSR observations, the spatial thinning algorithm for geostationary satellite observations will be modified.

A copy of the official note announcing the implementation of these changes is available [at this link](https://dd.meteo.gc.ca/doc/genots/2016/03/15/NOCN03_CWAO_151730___00994).

## Tuesday May 7, 2013

The Canadian Meteorological Centre (CMC) adds METOP-1 data to the GPSRO dataset of its data assimilation system.

## Monday April 15, 2013

Satwinds from METEOSAT10 and ASCAT winds from METOP-1 are added to the Canadian Meteorological Centre's (CMC) data assimilation system.
