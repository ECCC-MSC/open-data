# Data and Products of the Regional Ensemble Storm Surge Prediction System (RESPS)

The Regional Ensemble storm Surge Prediction System (RESPS) produces storm surge forecasts using the DalCoast ocean model. DalCoast (Bernier and Thompson 2015) is a storm surge forecast system for the east coast of Canada based on the depth-integrated, barotropic and linearized form of the Princeton Ocean Model. The model is forced by the 10 meters winds and sea level pressure from the [Global Ensemble Prediction System (GEPS)](../nwp_geps/readme_geps_en.md).

## Access

### How to access the data

The data are currently available on the [MSC Datamart](../../msc-datamart/readme_en.md) data server.
