# Data and products of the statistically downscaled climate indices

High-resolution statistically downscaled climate indices based on model projections from 24 global climate models (GCMs) that participated in the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) are available. The climate indices are grouped into temperature-related, precipitation-related and agroclimatic categories.
