# Observation and forecast data generated in CSV format for the Air Quality Health Index (AQHI) program

This page describes the observation and forecast data available in CSV format for the [Air Quality Health Index AQHI](readme_aqhi_en.md) that are also available on the [Environment and Climate Change Canada website](https://meteo.gc.ca/airquality/pages/index_e.html). 

## Data location

MSC Datamart data can be [automatically retrieved with the Advanced Message Queuing Protocol (AMQP)](../../msc-datamart/amqp_en.md) as soon as they become available. An [overview and examples for accessing and using the Meteorological Service of Canada's open data](../../usage/readme_en.md) is also available.

The data is available via the HTTPS protocol. It is possible to access it with a standard browser. In this case, we obtain a list of links giving access to a CSV file.

The data can be accessed at the following address:

For "MONTHLY" files, the AQHI observations cover the period from month end (first line) to beginning of the month (in the last line). They are available on the MSC Datamart for a period of time of 12 months.

* **CSV files with AQHI observations calculated from backfilled or corrected data** (only files in "MONTHLY" format):

These products have the same description as for the "MONTHLY" files provided in 2.1.1. However, the content is different in that the AQHI values are calculated 48 hours after the validity time for allow the arrival of missing data and corrections for pollutants. 

* **CSV files with public AQHI forecasts** (only "MONTHLY" files) :

    * **Header**
  
The header is given on the first line and contains the following information:

    * Value (H+000 to H+048): model value derived at the observation station (for UMOSAQ) or interpolated at the observation station (for AQFM, UMOSAQMIST). 
  
## Notes

* Real-time CSV files are produced on an hourly basis and contain the data for the last 7 days. They are available on the MSC Datamart for a period of 8 days. "MONTHLY" CSV files are produced at the end of each month. They are available on the MSC Datamart for a period of 12 months.

* In the CSV files for the AQHI, the value of the first hour is always missing because the AQHI formula requires a minimum of two hours in the last 3 hours to calculate moving averages.

* In CSV files for UMOSAQ, it is possible that some values are missing since UMOS guidance may not be available for all hours. The availability of UMOS guidance for a specfic hour is dependent upon having sufficient historical data to be able to generate reliable predictive statistical equations.

* Air quality observations are distributed by provinces and municipalities. Provincial jurisdictions control how comments are communicated to the public. Quebec has not authorized the publication of air quality data in the form of an Air Quality Health Index (AQHI). This explains why there are no observations under the directory: [https://dd.weather.gc.ca/air_quality/aqhi/que/observation/](https://dd.weather.gc.ca/air_quality/aqhi/que/observation/). However, the Ministry of Sustainable Development, Environment and Climate Change and the City of Montreal also distribute some of their data on the American portal AirNow: [https://www.airnowtech.org/index.cfm?page=login](https://www.airnowtech.org/index.cfm?page=login).
