# Chronology of changes to the Canadian Land Data Assimilation System in the National Surface and River Prediction System (CaLDAS-NSRPS)

## Thursday, May 1, 2025

### The Canadian Land Data Assimilation System in the National Surface and River Prediction System (CaLDAS-NSRPS) is declared operational at the Canadian Meteorological Centre (CMC)

As of May 1st, 2025, the Canadian Meteorological Centre (CMC) of the Meteorological Service of Canada declares the Canadian Land Data Assimilation System in the National Surface and River Prediction System (CaLDAS-NSRPS, v4.0.1) operational.

## Monday, April 7, 2025

### Transition to GOES19 for skin temperature observationsin the National Surface and River Prediction System (CaLDAS-NSRPS) 

As of April 7, 2025, the GOES19 satellite is operational as GOES-East, replacing GOES16 at that orbital position. Following this transition, CaLDAS now uses GOES19 observations instead of GOES16 observations. These observations are assimilated using an ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) to produce skin temperature analyses.

### Introduction of short cut-off run in the National Surface and River Prediction System (CaLDAS-NSRPS) 

On January 7, 2025, starting with the 06Z run, a short cut-off run was introduced alongside the existing long cut-off run. This improvement allows initial surface conditions to be provided earlier in the day, facilitating land and hydrological forecasts for customers. The added run uses a shorter 3-hour data cutoff and is initialized from the previous 6-hour analysis generated by the long cutoff run, which operates with a 7-hour latency (e.g., the 00 UTC cycle starts at 07 UTC). Evaluations show that this update has no impact on results.

## Tuesday June 11, 2024

### Upgrade to Version 4.0.0 of the Canadian Land Data Assimilation System in the National Surface and River Prediction System (CaLDAS-NSRPS) at the Canadian Meteorological Centre

On Tuesday June 11, 2024, starting with the 1200 UTC run, the Meteorological Service of Canada's Canadian Meteorological Centre (CMC) will upgrade the Canadian Land Data Assimilation System in the National Surface and River Prediction System (CaLDAS-NSRPS) to v4.0.0

Significant changes:

* Improved IMS Data Upscaling
* Enhanced Precipitation-Phase Partitioning
* Utilization of relative humidity (HR) field from HRDPS forcings
* Transition to HRDPS Forcings for the skin temperature Retrieval
* Addressing Summer Cold Biases in Water Surfaces

## Tuesday June 28, 2022

### Upgrade to Version 3.2.0 of the CaLDAS-NSRPS adapted to the New High Performance Computing Infrastructure.

See details [at this link](../changelog_multisystems_en.md)

## Wednesday December 1st, 2021

### Upgrade to Version 3.1.0 of the Canadian Land Data Assimilation System in the National Surface and River Prediction System (CaLDAS-NSRPS) at the Canadian Meteorological Centre

Effective Wednesday, December 1st, 2021, the Canadian Meteorological Centre (CMC) will update the Canadian Land Data Assimilation System in the National Surface and River Prediction System (CaLDAS-NSRPS) to v3.1.0.
