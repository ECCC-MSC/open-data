# Chronology of changes to the Global Deterministic Wave Prediction System (GDWPS)

## Wednesday November 1, 2017

### The Global Deterministic Wave Prediction System (GDWPS) is declared operational at the Canadian Meteorological Centre (CMC)

Effective November 1, 2017, after over two years running in experimental mode, the Canadian Meteorological Centre (CMC) of the Meteorological Service of Canada declared operational the Global Deterministic Wave Prediction System (GDWPS v1.3.0).

A copy of the official note announcing the implementation of these changes is available at [this link](http://dd.meteo.gc.ca/doc/genots/2017/10/31/NOCN03_CWAO_311455___01870).

A technical note with more details on this system is available [at this link](https://collaboration.cmc.ec.gc.ca/cmc/cmoi/product_guide/docs/lib/op_systems/doc_opchanges/technote_gdwps_20150623_e.pdf).

## Tuesday June 23, 2015

### Experimental Global Deterministic Wave Prediction System (GDWPS) at the Canadian Meteorological Centre (CMC)

On Tuesday, June 23 2015, the Canadian Meteorological Centre implemented a new experimental Global Deterministic Wave Prediction System (GDWPS). The development of the GDWPS was made through a partnership with NCEP/NOAA.
