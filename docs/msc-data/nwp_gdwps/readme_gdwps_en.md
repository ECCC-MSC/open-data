# Data and Products of the Global Deterministic Wave Prediction System (GDWPS) 

The Global Deterministic Wave Prediction System (GDWPS) produces wave forecasts using the third generation spectral wave model WaveWatch III® (WW3). The model is forced by the 10 meters winds from the [Global Deterministic Prediction System (GDPS)](../nwp_gdps/readme_gdps_en.md). The GDPS forecast is a coupled atmosphere-ice-ocean model, its sea ice forecast is used by the GDWPS forecast to dampen or suppress wave growth in areas covered respectively with 25% to 75% and more than 75% ice.

WW3 (WAVEWATCH III® Development Group, WW3DG 2019) is a third generation spectral wave prediction model that solves the evolution of the energy balance equation for the 2-D wave energy spectrum without any prior assumptions on the shape of the spectrum. The WW3 model has been implemented by a growing number of national operational forecasting centres over the last several years.
