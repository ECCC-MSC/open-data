# Chronology of changes to the Canadian Arctic Prediction System (CAPS)

## Wednesday June 18th, 2025

### Decommission of HRDPS North, replaced again by the coupled Canadian Arctic Prediction System (CAPS)

On Wednesday June 18th, 2025, after 3.5 years, the uncoupled HRDPS North re-introduces two-way coupling with a regional ice-ocean model and retakes the name “Canadian Arctic Prediction System”. Some HRDPS North products will continue to be available, being fed by CAPS, until the fall (exact date to be determined).

The official note is available [at this link](https://dd.meteo.gc.ca/doc/genots/2025/06/18/NOCN03_CWAO_181500___38690).

The CAPS v3.0.0 technical specifications document is available [at this link](https://collaboration.cmc.ec.gc.ca/cmc/cmoi/product_guide/docs/tech_specifications/tech_specifications_CAPS_3.0.0_e.pdf).

### Decommission of CAPS, replaced by the HRDPS North on Wednesday December 1st, 2021.

After providing high resolution coupled forecasts over the Artic for almost 4 years, the Canadian Arctic Prediction System is replaced by the smaller uncoupled HRDPS North. Some CAPS products will now be generated by HRDPS North. 

A copy of the official announcement is available [at this link](https://dd.meteo.gc.ca/doc/genots/2021/11/26/NOCN03_CWAO_262118___50159).

## Tuesday June 28, 2018

### Major Upgrade to Version 1.1.0 of the experimental Canadian Arctic Prediction System (CAPS) at the Canadian Meteorological Centre

On Tuesday June 28 2018, starting with the 1200 UTC run, the Meteorological Service of Canada's Canadian Meteorological Centre (CMC) upgraded the experimental Canadian Arctic Prediction System (CAPS) to version 1.1.0.

The changes included in this upgrade are summarized as follows:

* __Introduction of two-way coupling with an ice-ocean model__. In the CAPS-1.1.0 forecast system, surface conditions evolve through coupling with an Ice-ocean model. This Ice-ocean model is also used in [RIOPS](/../nwp_riops/changelog_riops_en.md).

A short technical specification documentation of this system is available [at this link](https://collaboration.cmc.ec.gc.ca/cmc/CMOI/product_guide/docs/tech_specifications/CAPS-100_factsheet.pdf).

## Wednesday January 24, 2018

### Implementation of the experimental Canadian Arctic Prediction System (CAPS) 1.0.0 at the Canadian Meteorological Centre (CMC)

Effective January 24, 2018, the Canadian Meteorological Centre (CMC) of the Meteorological Service of Canada installed the new Canadian Arctic Prediction System (CAPS) in experimental mode. As part of this upgrade, the experimental system HRDPS-North will be decommissioned. All the products that were part of the HRDPS-North will now be produced by CAPS.

A copy of the official note announcing the implementation of these changes is available [at this link](https://dd.meteo.gc.ca/doc/genots/2018/01/24/NOCN03_CWAO_241435___00012).
