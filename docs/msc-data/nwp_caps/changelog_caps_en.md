## Tuesday June 28, 2018

### Major Upgrade to Version 1.1.0 of the experimental Canadian Arctic Prediction System (CAPS) at the Canadian Meteorological Centre

On Tuesday June 28 2018, starting with the 1200 UTC run, the Meteorological Service of Canada's Canadian Meteorological Centre (CMC) upgraded the experimental Canadian Arctic Prediction System (CAPS) to version 1.1.0.

The changes included in this upgrade are summarized as follows:

* __Introduction of two-way coupling with an ice-ocean model__. In the CAPS-1.1.0 forecast system, surface conditions evolve through coupling with an Ice-ocean model. This Ice-ocean model is also used in [RIOPS](/../nwp_riops/changelog_riops_en.md).

A short technical specification documentation of this system is available [at this link](https://collaboration.cmc.ec.gc.ca/cmc/CMOI/product_guide/docs/tech_specifications/CAPS-100_factsheet.pdf).

## Wednesday January 24, 2018

### Implementation of the experimental Canadian Arctic Prediction System (CAPS) 1.0.0 at the Canadian Meteorological Centre (CMC)

Effective January 24, 2018, the Canadian Meteorological Centre (CMC) of the Meteorological Service of Canada installed the new Canadian Arctic Prediction System (CAPS) in experimental mode. As part of this upgrade, the experimental system HRDPS-North will be decommissioned. All the products that were part of the HRDPS-North will now be produced by CAPS.

A copy of the official note announcing the implementation of these changes is available [at this link](https://dd.meteo.gc.ca/doc/genots/2018/01/24/NOCN03_CWAO_241435___00012).
