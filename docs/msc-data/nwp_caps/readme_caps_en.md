# Data and Products of the experimental Canadian Arctic Prediction System (CAPS)

The Canadian Arctic Prediction System (CAPS) is an experimental forecast system based on a limited-area (LAM) configuration of the Global Environmental Multiscale model (GEM). It covers the entire Arctic basin and Hudson Bay, with an horizontal grid spacing of approximately 3 km. The lowest momentum level is at an altitude of approximately 40 m. The CAPS is piloted by ECCC’s Global Deterministic Prediction System (GDPS), which provides initial and lateral boundary conditions for the atmospheric fields. The initial hydrometeor fields are recycled from the 12h forecast of the previous CAPS integration. The ocean-ice surface fields are provided through a two-way coupling with an ice-ocean model, whose configuration follows that of the Regional Ice Ocean Prediction System (RIOPS). The CAPS runs on a rotated lat-lon grid twice per day and is initialized at 00 and 12 UTC respectively with 48h integration.
