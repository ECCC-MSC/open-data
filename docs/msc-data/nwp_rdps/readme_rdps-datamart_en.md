# Regional Deterministic Prediction System (RDPS) data in GRIB2 format

Under the Regional Deterministic Prediction System (RDPS), the numerical weather prediction model is run on a variable-step grid with a 10 km central core resolution. The fields in the 10 km resolution regional GRIB2 dataset are made available on a 935 x 824 polar-stereographic grid covering North America and adjacent waters with a 10 km resolution at 60°N.

## Data location 

MSC Datamart data can be [automatically retrieved with the Advanced Message Queuing Protocol (AMQP)](../../msc-datamart/amqp_en.md) as soon as they become available. An [overview and examples to access and use the Meteorological Service of Canada's open data](../../usage/readme_en.md) is also available.

The data is available using the HTTPS protocol and resides in a directory that is plainly accessible to a web browser. Visiting that directory with an interactive browser will yield a raw listing of links, each link being a downloadable GRIB2 file.

The data can be accessed at the following URLs: 

* [https://dd.weather.gc.ca/model_gem_regional/10km/grib2/{HH}/{hhh}/](https://dd.weather.gc.ca/model_gem_regional/10km/grib2)

where :

* __HH__: Model run start, in UTC [00, 06, 12, 18]
* __hhh__: Forecast hour [000, 001, 002,..., 084]

## Technical specification of the grid

Values given to the parameters of the stereographic polar grid :

| Parameter | Value |
| ------ | ------ |
| ni | 935 |
| nj | 824 | 
| resolution at 60° N | 10 km |
| coordinates of the first grid point | 18.1429° N  142.8968° W | 
| (i,j) coordinate of North Pole | (456.2; 732.4) |
| grid orientation (with respect to j axis) | -111.0° |

## Filename nomenclature 

Note : all hours are in UTC.

The files have the following nomenclature :

CMC_reg_Variable_LevelType_level_ps10km_YYYYMMDDHH_Phhh.grib2

where :

* __CMC__ : constant string indicating that the data is from the Canadian Meteorological Centre
* __reg__ : constant string indicating that the data is from the RDPS
* __Variable__ : Variable type included in this file. To consult a complete list, refer to the variables section.
* __LevelType__ : Level type. To consult a complete list, refer to the variables section.
* __Level__ : Level value. To consult a complete list, refer to the variables section.
* __ps10km__ : constant string indicating that the projection used is polar-stereographic at 10km resolution.
* __YYYYMMDD__ : Year, month and day of the beginning of the forecast.
* __HH__ : UTC run time [00, 06, 12, 18]
* __Phhh__ : P is a constant character. hhh is the forecast hour [000,001,002,...,084] 
* __grib2__ : constant string indicating the GRIB2 format is used

Example of file name : 

CMC_reg_DEPR_ISBL_1015_ps10km_2010091306_P027.grib2

This file originates from the Canadian Meteorological Center (CMC) and contains the data of the RDPS. The data in the file start on September 13th 2010 at 06Z (2010091306). It contains the dew point depression (DEPR) at the isobaric level 1015 mb (ISBL_1015) on a polar-stereographic at 10km resolution (ps10km) for the forecast hour 27 (P027) in GRIB2 format (.grib2).

## Levels

Vertical coverage of three-dimensional fields is provided by up to 33 isobaric levels.

* Isobaric levels (hPa): 1015, 1000, 985, 970, 950, 925, 900, 850, 800, 750, 700, 650, 600, 550, 500, 450, 400, 350, 300, 275, 250, 225, 200, 175, 150, 100, 50.

    * Additional levels 30, 20, 10, 5 et 1 hPa for the variables TMP, HGT, UGRD, VGRD, WIND, WDIR, SPFH

    * Additional levels 30, 20 et 10 hPa for the variables RH et DEPR

* Some fields receive limited three-dimensional coverage of five levels in the vertical, namely 850, 700, 600, 500, 250 hPa.

Additional levels that may be applicable to a given parameter are :

* Surface
* Fixed height above ground
* Fixed height below ground
* Thickness between two isobaric levels
* Nominal top of the atmosphere
* Entire atmospheric column

Notes :

* u (UGRD) and v (VGRD) components of the wind vector are to be resolved relative to the defined grid, in the direction of increasing i and j coordinates. Please refer to Code Table 7 of the GRIB standard for further details.
* Radiation fluxes parameters NLWRS_SFC, DSWRF_NTAT, and DLWRF_NTAT are encoded as accumulated values, as per value 4 of the Time Range Indicator (Code Table 5 of the GRIB format standard). This changes the unit from Watts per square metre to Joules per square meter.
* Specific Humidity (SPFH) is the model's native moisture variable. It should be used in all NWP applications. Dew point depression (DEPR) is a diagnostic parameter and is not meant for use in high-precision applications.
* The Storm Severity Index ([SSI](https://collaboration.cmc.ec.gc.ca/cmc/cmos/public_doc/msc-data/nwp_rdps/SSI_en.png)) has been developped by ECCC in the late 80s.
* UV index maximums are daily maximums based on the current hour and the previous 23 hours (also applies to UV index under clear sky). They are available at the following forecast hours, depending on the system run:
    * 00Z run: 18h, 42h and 66h
    * 06Z run: 12h, 36h and 60h
    * 12Z run: 6h , 30h and 54h
    * 18Z run: 0h , 24h and 48h
