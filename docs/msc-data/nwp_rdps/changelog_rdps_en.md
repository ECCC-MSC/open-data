## Tuesday May 6th 2014

### Addition of IASI observations from METOP-B/1 to the operational data of the RDPS

On May 6th, 2014, starting with the 1200 UTC prediction run of the Regional Deterministic Prediction System (RDPS), the Canadian Meteorological Centre (CMC) of Environment Canada added radiance observations from the IASI instrument aboard the METOP-B/1 satellite to the operational data assimilation system. IASI is the last of the instruments on-board the METOP-B/1 satellite to be included in the operational data assimilation systems.

Motivation for the incorporation of IASI observations from METOP-B/1 in the operational data of the RDPS:

Although IASI data from METOP-A/2 will continue to be assimilated into our forecast systems, METOP-B/1 is now the operational METOP satellite of the EUMETSAT agency. The two satellites METOP-A/2 and METOP-B/1 have similar trajectories, but offset by a half-orbit, so the addition of METOP-B/1 IASI data will almost double the number of IASI data assimilated. Furthermore, these new data add robustness to the data assimilation system in the event of a failure of the IASI instrument on-board either METOP-A/2 or METOP-B/1.

Following this change, the version of the RDPS system is changed from 3.2.0 to 3.2.1.

A copy of the official note announcing the implementation of this change along with information on verification work leading up to this implementation is available [at this link](http://dd.meteo.gc.ca/doc/genots/2014/05/08/NOCN03_CWAO_081640___00938).


## Thursday November 7 2013

### Additional satellite data (CSR, ATOVS, polar winds) added to the RDPS assimilation systems and various other adjustments

On Thursday November 7 2013, additional satellite data was added to the operational data assimilation system of the Global Deterministic Prediction System (GDPS). Changes include the following: additional CSR (Clear Sky Radiance) radiances from MeteoSat10, additional ATOVS radiances from Metop-B and additional AVHRR polar winds from Metop-B.

Along with the addition of satellite data, there were also other adjustments made to the systems. There was an update of the spectroscopic coefficient files used by the RTTOV radiative transfer model for computing the simulated observations (the 6-hour "P"rognosis portion of the Observations-Prognosis (O-P) of the AMSUB and MHS instruments onboard all satellites. These new coefficients labelled as "Newstyle" do not separate out water vapor transmittances into line absorption and continuum absorption. The impact on the results are neutral.

As was done for the RDPS at the time of the implementation of the [RDPS 3.1.0](../nwp_rdps/changelog_rdps_en.md)) the snow cover field (known internall at CMC as the parameter NE) was missing in the background check of AIRS and IASI data. To resolve this, the parameter snow depth (known internally in CMC as the parameter SD) will be used instead. No significant meteorological impact was observed. Also it had been observed there was an incorrect interpolation of the albedo field (known internally at CMC as the parameter AL) during the background check of AIRS and IASI data. To address this the solution is that AL is now interpolated correctly, using the CMC package EzScInt. As a result, the number of AIRS and IASI observations has increased by up to 50% and 30%, respectively, depending on the season (i.e. as a function of the distribution of ice).

As a result of all of the above changes installed in this implementation, the RDPS operational system becomes version 3.2.0


## Tuesday July 3rd 2013

### Update to the RDPS binary (in support of the production of the variable PX)


## Wednesday February 13, 2013

### Regional Deterministic Prediction System (RDPS) version 3.1.0 installed at the Canadian Meteorological Centre

On Wednesday February 13 2013, starting with the 1200 UTC run, the Canadian Meteorological Centre (CMC) will implement version 3.1.0 of the Regional Deterministic Prediction System (RDPS) in order to harmonize it with the [implementation on that same day of the GDPS-3.0.0](../nwp_gdps/changelog_gdps_en.md). As a result, RDPS forecasts are improved as a result.

Please consult the documentation available regarding the GDPS-3.0.0 implementation [at this link for more information](../nwp_gdps/changelog_gdps_en.md).


## Wednesday October 19 2012

### Regional Deterministic Prediction System (RDPS) Data Assimilation Window extended by 5 minutes

Starting with the 18Z run of October 19 2012, the [00,06,12,18]Z runs of the RDPS will now be launched at [00,06,12,18]Z+2:00 allowing those runs to collect an additional 5 minutes of observation data prior to the model integration.


## Wednesday October 3 2012

### Major Upgrade to the Regional Deterministic Prediction System (RDPS) at the Canadian Meteorological Centre

On Wednesday October 3 2012, starting with the 1200 UTC run, the Canadian Meteorological Centre (CMC) will implement version 3.0.0 of the Regional Deterministic Prediction System (RDPS). This version includes an increase in resolution to 10 km from the previous 15 km, a 4D-Var data assimilation system replacing the previous 3D-Var, as well as important changes in the GEM model physics. This results in significant forecast improvements especially for the winter season.

As part of this implementation the cutoff time for collecting observations has been reduced by 10 minutes and is now [00,06,12,18]Z+1:55

Objective scores show improvements in the forecasts with most metrics throughout most of the atmosphere, in particular for the lower portion of the atmosphere and at the surface. A subjective evaluation by operational meteorologists confirmed those improvements. Other forecast systems which depend on RDPS ouput include similar changes and as a result they also benefit from this version of the RDPS.

A copy of the official note describing these changes and the verification work leading up to this implementation [is available by clicking here](http://dd.weatheroffice.ec.gc.ca/doc/genots/2012/10/02/NOCN03_CWAO_021644___00044).

## Wednesday November 16, 2011

### Improvements to the Regional Deterministic Prediction System (RDPS v 2.0.0) of the Canadian Meteorological Centre

Starting on November 16 2011 at 06 UTC, the Canadian Meteorological Centre (CMC) will implement changes to the regional data assimilation system by incorporating additional satellite data and by introducing a higher quality analysis of the sea surface temperature.

Here is an overview of changes involving the regional data assimilation system:

A. New Satellite Data: The following satellite data will be incorporated in the global and regional data assimilation systems:

* Sixty-two (62) infrared channels from the IASI instrument on board the METOP satellite.
* Seven (7) microwave channels from the SSM/IS instrument on board the DMSP F16 satellite.
* One (1) water vapor channel from the GOES-W, METSAT-1R and both METEOSAT satellites.
* A restriction to the infrared channels of the AIRS instrument in the polar regions will be removed.
* The horizontal thinning of all satellite radiance data, currently done at 250 km (except 200 km for SSM/I) will be reduced to 150 km, therefore adding much more satellite data to the systems.

B. Other Assimilation Changes:

* Moisture observations measured from properly equipped aircraft (AMDAR) will be assimilated.
* A new satellite data bias correction scheme will replace the current one. The main impact is the reduction of the time period to compute the bias corrections from 15 to 7 days. the same code is used for all radiance data.
* A modified version of the RTTOV radiative transfer code will be used for satellite radiance data.
* Also, a new sea surface temperature analysis on a grid of 0.20 degrees resolution will be used now by the regional system.

All of the above changes were combined and tested extensively during winter and summer seasons, including a parallel run of the global system. The data assimilation changes were also tested in the regional system over similar test periods, including a parallel run.

A copy of the text of the official note which includes additional information on the evaluation of these changes is available [by clicking here](http://dd.weatheroffice.ec.gc.ca/doc/genots/2011/11/15/NOCN03_CWAO_152020___05806).

With these changes the RDPS is now version 2.0.0
