# Data and Products of the experimental Regional Ice Ocean Prediction System (RIOPS)

The Regional Ice Ocean Prediction System (RIOPS) provides 48 hr ice and ocean forecasts four times per day on a 1/12° resolution grid (3-8 km). RIOPS is initialized using analyses from the [Global Ice-Ocean Prediction System (GIOPS)](../nwp_giops/readme_giops_en.md). Atmospheric fluxes for 48 hr forecasts are calculated using fields from the [Regional Deterministic Prediction System (RDPS)](../nwp_rdps/readme_rdps_en.md).
