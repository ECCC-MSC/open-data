# Data and Products of the Regional Ice Ocean Prediction System (RIOPS)

The Regional Ice Ocean Prediction System (RIOPS) provides ice and ocean forecasts up to 84 hours, four times per day on a 1/12° resolution grid (3-8 km). RIOPS is initialized using analyses from the [Global Ice-Ocean Prediction System (GIOPS)](../nwp_giops/readme_giops_en.md). Atmospheric fluxes up to 84 hours forecasts are calculated using fields from a component of the [Global Deterministic Prediction System (GDPS)](../nwp_gdps/readme_gdps_en.md) at 10km horizontal resolution
