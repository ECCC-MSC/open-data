# Vertical profiles observation data in CSV format

This page describes the [vertical profiles data of observations](readme_vertical-profiles-obs_en.md) available on the MSC Datamart. The observation data (ObsTephi) contain all levels data received from actual sounding.

## Data location 

MSC Datamart data can be [automatically retrieved with the Advanced Message Queuing Protocol (AMQP)](../../msc-datamart/amqp_en.md) as soon as they become available. An [overview and examples to access and use the Meteorological Service of Canada's open data](../../usage/readme_en.md) is also available.

The data is available using the HTTPS protocol and resides in a directory that is plainly accessible to a web browser. Visiting that directory with an interactive browser will yield a raw listing of links, each link being a downloadable CSV file.

The vertical profiles files are available at the following address :

[https://dd.weather.gc.ca/vertical_profile/observation/csv](https://dd.weather.gc.ca/vertical_profile/observation/csv)

## Filename nomenclature 

The filenames have the following nomenclature :

ObsTephi_HH_AAAA.csv

where :

* __HH__ : Run hour. Can be "00" or "12".
* __AAAA__ : 4 letters station code. A [complete list of stations](https://collaboration.cmc.ec.gc.ca/cmc/cmos/public_doc/msc-data/prev_vertical-profiles/station_list_for_vertical_profile.geojson) is available.

Example : 

ObsTephi_12_WASA.csv

## Data description 

Data provided and units are as the following :

* __TT__ : Temperature  (deg C)
* __ES__ : Dew point depression (deg C)
* __WD__ : Wind direction (deg true)
* __UV__ : Wind speed (knots)
* __HR__ : Relative humidity (decimal fraction; e.g.  .58 = 58%) 
* __GZ__ : Geopotential height (decametres with 2 digits after the decimal)
* __WW__ : Vertical velocity  (Pa/sec)

The data are available on the following pressure levels :

* Surface level
* GZ, ES, UV, WD, HR and TT available at: SFC 1000 985 970 950 925 900 875 850 800 750 700 650 600 550 500 450 400 350 300 275 250 225 200175  150 100  70  50  30  20  10 mb
* WW for 29 levels (Not at 70, 30 or 20 mb)

__Note__ : Some of the pressure levels may be below the elevation of the station.
