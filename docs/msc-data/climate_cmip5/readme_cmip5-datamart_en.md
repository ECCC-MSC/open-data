# Climate scenarios datasets based on an ensemble of global climate model projections from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) in NetCDF format

Multi-model ensembles of modelled output and projected change are available for historical simulations and three emission scenarios, RCP2.6, RCP4.5 and RCP8.5, at a 1x1 degree grid resolution. Projected changes are expressed as anomalies with respect to the reference period of 1986-2005. 

## Data location

MSC Datamart data can be [automatically retrieved with the Advanced Message Queuing Protocol (AMQP)](../../msc-datamart/amqp_en.md) as soon as they become available. An [overview and examples to access and use the Meteorological Service of Canada's open data](../../usage/readme_en.md) is also available.

The data is available via the HTTPS protocol. It is possible to access it with a standard browser. In this case, we obtain a list of links giving access to a NetCDF file.

The data can be accessed at the following URLs :

The file represents the 50th percentile of the CMIP5 multi-model ensemble of projected relative changes in mean precipitation (i.e., anomalies) with respect to the reference period of 1986-2005, in winter (3 month average across December, January, February), expressed as percentage change. The bands in the NetCDF file are yearly time steps.
