## Wednesday December 4th 2013

#### Major Upgrade to the Global Ensemble Prediction System (GEPS) version 3.1.0 at the Canadian Meteorological Centre

On Wednesday December 4th 2013, starting with the 1200 UTC run the Meteorological Service of Canada's Canadian Meteorological Centre (CMC) will upgrade the Global Ensemble Prediction System (GEPS) to version 3.1.0.

This new version of GEPS will use a newer version of the GEM model (from 4.4.1 to 4.4.5). This change purely technical resulting in no difference in the forecasts in GEPS but allows easier system maintenance and greater consistency with other prediction systems at CMC.

On the assimilation part of the GEPS, we can say that radiance data ATOVS and AVHRR polar winds from an additional satellite, the METOP-B, are now assimilated. Also, there was an update of the spectroscopic coefficient used by the RTTOV radiative transfer model for computing the simulated observations of the AMSUB and MHS instruments onboard all satellites. Although the impacts of these changes on the forecasts are neutral, they can improve the robustness of the assimilation component of the system.

For the forecast component of the GEPS, the most important change is in the treatment of the surface temperature of the sea (SST). In the new GEPS, the SST value evolves with the forecast time using the persistence of the anomaly (deviation from the climatology) method. The SST value will change linearly with time (daily interpolation) from the initial value of the analysis of CMC toward the next mid-month value of the SST climatology, plus the initial SST anomaly.

Also, monthly forecasts (32 days) will be produced once a week on every Thursday at 00Z. Although the extended forecasts data will be available with this implementation, the introduction of specific monthly forecasts products is planned for later in 2014.

Another new element in GEPS 3.1.0 is the addition of historical ensemble forecasts for the last 18 years. These historical forecasts will be produced each week with a reduced set of 4 members (instead of 20). The outputs of this reforecast database will be used to generate statistics of climate model forecasts for monthly and eventually to calculate the Extreme Forecast Index (EFI) and to calibrate probabilistic forecasts.

A copy of the official note announcing the implementation of these changes along with information on verification work leading up to this implementation [is available at this link](http://dd.meteo.gc.ca/doc/genots/2013/12/03/NOCN03_CWAO_032258___00953).

## Wednesday February 13, 2013

#### Major upgrade to the Global Ensemble Prediction System (GEPS) version 3.0.0 at the Canadian Meteorological Centre

On Wednesday February 13th 2013, starting with the 1200 UTC run the Meteorological Service of Canada's Canadian Meteorological Centre (CMC) will upgrade the Global Ensemble Prediction System (GEPS) to version 3.0.0.

In this upgrade, major changes are brought to both the assimilation (Ensemble Kalman Filter or ENKF) and forecast components of the system. The ENKF is used to supply initial conditions to the GEPS, while the forecast component provides forecasts out to 16 days using the Canadian Global Environmental Multi-scale model (GEM). Those forecasts are shared with North American Ensemble Forecast System (NAEFS) partners, hence changes to our system will have an impact on the NAEFS forecasts.

Changes common to both the assimilation and forecast components include: a newer version 4.4.1 of the GEM model with improved physics; reduction of the model time step from 30 minutes to 20 minutes; use of a filtered topography; and the use now of only one surface scheme (ISBA) (the previous scheme Force-Restore is no longer used).

Changes installed uniquely into the data assimilation component ENKF include: horizontal localization length scale now increasing with height; higher horizontal resolution (now ~66km); higher vertical resolution increased from 58 to 74 levels with the model top remaining at 2 hPa; an increased volume of AMSU radiance observations; and improved observation bias correction coming from the [newer version 3.0.0 of the GDPS](../nwp_gdps/changelog_gdps_en.md).

Changes installed uniquely into the forecast component include: adjustments to how physics tendencies are perturbed for convective precipitation; the physics tendencies perturbations are applied at every level except the very last one; addition of diffusion into the advection procedure; perturbation of the bulk drag coefficient in the orographic blocking scheme; and fine tuning of the adjustment factor alpha of the stochastic kinetic energy backscattering scheme.

ENKF version 3.0.0 results in overall significant positive impacts on the analyses and trial fields of winds and temperature for almost the entire atmospheric column with some degradation in the bias of the zonal wind component at high levels. The geopotential heights error standard deviations are lowered in the troposphere. The biases of geopotential heights and temperature are reduced significantly.

The forecast component of GEPS-3.0.0 brings a major improvement in upper air 16â¬day forecasts in the extra-tropics. There is less spread in the forecast of the new system while the forecasts are better.

The upper air forecast from the Regional Ensemble Prediction System (REPS) will benefit significantly from having better initial and lateral boundary conditions from the GEPS-3.0.0.

The North American Ensemble Forecast System (NAEFS) upper air forecasts will also improve significantly for day 1 to day 10 lead times with the contribution of GEPS-3.0.0.

Hardware improvements coinciding with this implementation will result in some products being ready between 10 to 120 minutes sooner than their present time of production.
