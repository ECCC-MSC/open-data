# Satellite observation data and products

This page describes data and products from weather satellites operated by NOAA (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration). The instruments aboard these satellites provide observations of the Earth's surface at a generally high temporal and spatial resolution. These observations of atmospheric humidity, cloud cover, surface temperature, lightning occurrence and many other characteristics enable us to monitor and forecast weather conditions across the globe.

Among these satellites, the [GOES (Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite) series, designed by NASA](https://science.nasa.gov/mission/goes/) for NOAA are part of a global network of weather satellites that are placed in geostationary orbit 36,000 km above the equator and aligned at 70º longitude intervals around the Earth to provide almost total coverage of the globe. Two GOES satellites each see a third of the Earth: the first satellite is located at 75ºW longitude and monitors North America, South America and most of the Atlantic Ocean. The second is located near longitude 135ºW and monitors western North America and the Pacific Ocean basin, together covering the region from longitude 20ºW to 165ºE.

## Access

### How to access data

Satellite data are available via MSC's GeoMet API and web services, as well as on MSC's Datamart data server:

* [Data available on the GeoMet-Weather geospatial web services](../../msc-geomet/readme_en.md)   
* GOES satellite data in GeoTIFF format available on the MSC Datamart](readme_satellite-datamart_en.md)
 
[An overview and examples of how to access and use Meteorological Service of Canada open data](../../usage/readme_en.md) is available.

### License
