### GOES-East Satellite: Transition from GOES16 to GOES19

On Monday, April 7, 2025, the Canadian Meteorological Centre (CMC) of the Meteorological Service of Canada (MSC) migrated to data from the GOES19 satellite, the latest in NOAA's GOES-R series, which replaced the GOES16 satellite in operational service.

Official announcement: https://www.noaa.gov/news-release/noaas-goes-19-satellite-now-operational-providing-critical-new-data-to-forecasters

The [images](https://meteo.gc.ca/satellite/index_e.html) are now available on the ECCC website and the data is being used in the operational chain. The [open data](https://eccc-msc.github.io/open-data/msc-data/obs_satellite/readme_satellite_en/) also benefits from this migration.
