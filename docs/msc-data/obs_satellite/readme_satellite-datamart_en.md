# Satellite data and products

This page describes data and products derived from GOES-West and GOES-East [satellite](readme_satellite_en.md) instruments in GeoTIFF format available on the MSC Datamart. 

These products are derived from [RGB](https://collaboration.cmc.ec.gc.ca/cmc/cmos/public_doc/msc-data/obs_satellite/what_is_an_rgb_en.pdf) (red/green/blue) images, a satellite processing technique that uses a combination of satellite sensor bands (also called channels) and applies a red/green/blue (RGB) filter to each of them. The result is a false-color image, i.e. an image that does not correspond to what the human eye would see, but offers high contrast between different cloud types and surface features. The on-board sensor of a weather satellite obtains two basic types of information: visible light data (reflected light) reflecting off clouds and different surface types, also known as "reflectance", and infrared data (emitted radiation) which are short-wave and long-wave radiation emitted by clouds and surface features. RGBs are specially designed to combine this type of satellite data, resulting in an information-rich final product.

Other products are based on the enhancement of channel data for a single wavelength, also aimed at highlighting meteorological features of the observed surface or clouds, but in a simpler way since only a single wavelength is involved. This older approach is still useful today, as its simplicity makes image interpretation easier in some cases.

## Data location 

MSC Datamart data can be [automatically retrieved with the Advanced Message Queuing Protocol (AMQP)](../../msc-datamart/amqp_en.md) as soon as it becomes available. An [overview and examples of how to access and use Meteorological Service of Canada open data](../../usage/readme_en.md) is also available.

The data is available via the HTTPS protocol. It can be accessed using a standard browser. In this case, a list of links to a GeoTIFF file is displayed.

GOES-R series products can be found at :

* [https://dd.weather.gc.ca/satellite/goes/[west|east]/{HH}/](https://dd.weather.gc.ca/satellite/goes/)

where :

* __HH__: Time in UTC of image validity [00, 01, .., 23]

## File name nomenclature 

File names follow the nomenclature below:

`{YYYYMMDD}T{HHmm}Z_MSC_{GOES-Sat}_{Product}_{resolution}.tif`

where :

* __YYYYMMDD__: Year, month and day of image validity
* __T__: Time delimiter according to ISO8601 standards
* __HHmm__: Hour and minute in UTC of image validity time [00, 01, 02, ...., 22, 23] 
* __Z__: Time zone (UTC time)
* __MSC__: Constant string for Meteorological Service of Canada, the data source
* __GOES-Sat__ : String indicating that data are derived from GOES satellites [GOES-East, GOES-West]
* __Product__: String indicating the type of satellite product generated [Ash, FireTemperature, etc.]. See the section on file contents
* __resolution__ : Horizontal resolution of data [1km, 2km]
* __tif__ : Constant string indicating that the format is GeoTIFF 

Examples: 

* 20231109T0800Z_MSC_GOES-East_NaturalColor_1km.tif
* 20231109T0510Z_MSC_GOES-West_SnowFog-NightMicrophysics_1km.tif

## File contents

It is important to note that products using visible light channels cannot be generated during the hours of the night when no portion of the Earth's disk seen by the satellite is directly illuminated by the sun. These products have a nominal resolution of 1km. Their higher resolution makes the latter products more popular, but when produced individually they are not available during most of the night (between 02UTC and 07UTC for GOES-East, and between 06UTC and 11UTC for GOES-West). On the other hand, products using only infrared channels are generated day and night, and are therefore available 24 hours a day at a nominal resolution of 2km.
 
By combining products using only infrared radiation with products using reflected sunlight, we obtain combined products generated around the clock, where the daytime illuminated part uses visible light channels, and the night-time part uses only infrared radiation channels.
 
Fifteen types of products are currently generated from the GOES-West and GOES-East satellites. They are described below according to the type of individual or combined "day-night" products (see links in tables and list of available combinations) :
