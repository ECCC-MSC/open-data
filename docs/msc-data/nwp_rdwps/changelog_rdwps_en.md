## Monday March 4, 2019

### Upgrades to the Regional Deterministic Wave Prediction System (RDWPS) at the Canadian Meteorological Centre (CMC)

Effective March 4, 2019, the Canadian Meteorological Centre (CMC) of the Meteorological Service of Canada will update the Regional Deterministic Wave Prediction System (RDWPS) to v3.2.0.

RDWPS v3.2.0 is different from the previous operational system in that the ice analysis used as input for it has been replaced by an ice forecast provided by the Water Cycle Prediction System (WCPS v2.0.0), which was declared operational on March 4, 2019.

A copy of the official note announcing the implementation of these changes is available [at this link](http://dd.meteo.gc.ca/doc/genots/2019/03/05/NOCN03_CWAO_051918___12705).

The technical specifications document for RDWPS 3.2.0 is available [at this link](https://collaboration.cmc.ec.gc.ca/cmc/cmoi/product_guide/docs/tech_specifications/tech_specifications_RDWPS_3.2.0_e.pdf).


## Wednesday April 4, 2018

### The new Regional Deterministic Wave Prediction System (RDWPS) is declared operational at the Canadian Meteorological Centre (CMC)

Effective April 4, 2018, the Canadian Meteorological Centre (CMC) of the Meteorological Service of Canada declared operational the new Regional Deterministic Wave Prediction System (RDWPS v3.0.0).
