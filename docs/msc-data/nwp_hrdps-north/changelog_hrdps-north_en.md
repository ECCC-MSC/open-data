# Chronology of changes to the High Resolution Deterministic Prediction System North (HRDPS-North)

## Wednesday June 18, 2025

### Decommission of HRDPS-North, replaced by CAPS 

After nearly four years of high-resolution coupled forecasts for the Arctic, the HRDPS-North will be decommissioned on Wednesday, June 18, 2025.

The official announcement is available [via this link](https://dd.weather.gc.ca/doc/genots/2025/06/18/NOCN03_CWAO_XXXXXXX).

### Upgrade to Version 2.1.0 of the High Resolution Deterministic Prediction System North (HRDPS-North) at the Canadian Meteorological Centre

On Tuesday June 11st, 2024, starting with the 1200 UTC run, the Canadian Meteorological Centre (CMC) will upgrade the High Resolution Deterministic Prediction System North (HRDPS-North) to version 2.1.0.

Significant changes:

* Upgraded to GEM version 5.2.1, enhancing atmospheric physics and improving model performance. 
* Bourgouin approach for surface precipitation phase partitioning.  
* Improved initial and boundary conditions sourced from a component of the upgraded [Global Deterministic Prediction System (GDPS)](../nwp_gdps/readme_gdps_en.md) at 10km horizontal resolution.  
* Updated ocean-ice initial conditions from the [Regional Ice-Ocean Prediction System (RIOPS)](../nwp_riops/readme_riops_en.md), providing more accurate sea-ice data. 
* Implemented the SLEVE vertical coordinate system.

### Upgrade to Version 2.0.0 of the High Resolution Deterministic Prediction System North (HRDPS-N) at the Canadian Meteorological Centre

On Wednesday, August 30, 2023, starting with the 1200 UTC run, the Canadian Meteorological Centre (CMC) will upgrade the High Resolution Deterministic Prediction System North (HRDPS-N) to version 2.0.0.

The major changes included in this upgrade are summarized as follows:

* Fields calculated on a much large domain
* Initial and lateral boundary conditions for the atmosphere from the latest operational version of the Global Deterministic Prediction System (GDPS) whose details are available [at this link](https://collaboration.cmc.ec.gc.ca/cmc/cmoi/product_guide/docs/tech_specifications/tech_specifications_GDPS_8.0.0_e.pdf) 
* Oceanic initial conditions are provided by the Regional Ice Ocean Prediction System (RIOPS) whose details are available [at this link](https://collaboration.cmc.ec.gc.ca/cmc/cmoi/product_guide/docs/tech_specifications/tech_specifications_RIOPS_2.2.0_e.pdf)

## Tuesday June 28, 2022

### Upgrade to Version 1.2.0 of the HRDPS-N adapted to the New High Performance Computing Infrastructure.

See details [at this link](../changelog_multisystems_en.md).

## Wednesday December 1st, 2021

### Upgrade to Version 1.0.0 of the High Resolution Deterministic Prediction System North (HRDPS-N) at the Canadian Meteorological Centre

On Wednesday December 1st, 2021, starting with the 1200 UTC run, the Canadian Meteorological Centre (CMC) will retire the Canadian Arctic Prediction System ([CAPS](../nwp_caps/readme_caps_en.md)) and replace it with the High Resolution Deterministic Prediction System North (HRDPS-N) version 1.0.0.

The changes included in this upgrade are summarized as follows :

* Remove the ice-ocean coupling (CAPS was coupled).
* Migration to GEM version 5.1 with retro-physic.
* Model configuration similar to HRDPS-National.
* New geophysical fields.
* New version of the RDPS pilot model, [version 8.0.0](../nwp_rdps/changelog_rdps_en.md#wednesday-december-1st-2021).
