# Meteocode forecast data in CSV format

This document describes the content of the [meteocode data](readme_meteocode_en.md) in CSV format.

The files for meteocode terrestrial data in CSV format are created from the CMML files using the [XSLT](https://collaboration.cmc.ec.gc.ca/cmc/cmos/public_doc/msc-data/meteocode/cmml2csv.xsl) technology. The CSV files does not contain more information than the CMML files, they are only in a different format. Moreover, each CMML files contains many regions while each CSV file contains only one region.

## Data address 

MSC Datamart data can be [automatically retrieved with the Advanced Message Queuing Protocol (AMQP)](../../msc-datamart/amqp_en.md) as soon as they become available. An [overview and examples to access and use the Meteorological Service of Canada's open data](../../usage/readme_en.md) is also available.

The data is available via the HTTPS protocol. It is possible to access it with a standard browser. In this case, we obtain a list of links giving access to a CSV file.

The files are available at the following address :

* [https://dd.weather.gc.ca/today/meteocode/mtm/csv/](https://dd.weather.gc.ca/today/meteocode/mtm/csv/)
* [https://dd.weather.gc.ca/today/meteocode/mtm/csv/](https://dd.weather.gc.ca/today/meteocode/ont/csv/)
* [https://dd.weather.gc.ca/today/meteocode/pnr/csv/](https://dd.weather.gc.ca/today/meteocode/pnr/csv/)

## File name nomenclature 

The filenames of the meteocode CSV files have the following nomenclature :

YYYY-MM-DDTHH-MM-SSZ_FPAANN_rRRRR_BB.csv

where :

* **YYYY-MM-DDTHH-MM-SSZ** : Time of emission for the forecast. Date is in ISO 8601 format. 
* **FP** : Constant string meaning "Forecast Public".
* **ANN** : See the section 'File name nomenclature' in the [CMML documentation](readme_meteocode-datamartxml_en.md)
* **r** : Constant string indicating the beginning of the region code.
* **RRRR** : Alphanumerical code indicating the region of the public forecast. Can be of an arbitrary length (ex: 3pe, 10zf, 71.14). The complete list of forecast region and their associated code can be found at the end of this file in the section "Region's code and name".
* **BB** : String indicating the weather elements. Can be one of the following values: TA (Air Temperature), TD (Dew Point), PA (Precipitation accumulation), POP (Probability Of Precipitation), WS (Wind Speed and Direction), WG (Wind Gust), CC (Cloud Cover).

**Note**:

The [region's code and name correspondence](https://collaboration.cmc.ec.gc.ca/cmc/cmos/public_doc/msc-data/meteocode/table_region_code_name.xlsx) is available.

The codes are separated by the forecast offices because the same code can be used by more than one region, as:

    bulletin code, region code, French name, English name

## File content

* For each forecast region, 7 files are created. The content of each file is described below.
* The ''-9999.00'' value is for a missing or an invalid data for air temperature or dew point.
* If no wind gust is available for the forecast valid time in the CMML files, then the associated CSV file contains no data for this specific date.
* All dates are in ISO 8601 format.
