# Chronology of changes to the High Resolution Deterministic Prediction System North (HRDPS-N)

## Wednesday August 30, 2023

### Upgrade to Version 2.0.0 of the High Resolution Deterministic Prediction System North (HRDPS-N) at the Canadian Meteorological Centre

On Wednesday, August 30, 2023, starting with the 1200 UTC run, the Canadian Meteorological Centre (CMC) will upgrade the High Resolution Deterministic Prediction System North (HRDPS-N) to version 2.0.0.

The major changes included in this upgrade are summarized as follows:

* Fields calculated on a much large domain
* Initial and lateral boundary conditions for the atmosphere from the latest operational version of the Global Deterministic Prediction System (GDPS) whose details are available [at this link](https://collaboration.cmc.ec.gc.ca/cmc/cmoi/product_guide/docs/tech_specifications/tech_specifications_GDPS_8.0.0_e.pdf) 
* Oceanic initial conditions are provided by the Regional Ice Ocean Prediction System (RIOPS) whose details are available [at this link](https://collaboration.cmc.ec.gc.ca/cmc/cmoi/product_guide/docs/tech_specifications/tech_specifications_RIOPS_2.2.0_e.pdf)

The official note announcing the implementation of these changes is available [at this link](https://dd.weather.gc.ca/doc/genots/2023/08/29/NOCN03_CWAO_XXXXXX_XXXXX).

A technical note with more details on the HRDPS-N 2.0.0 is available [at this link](https://collaboration.cmc.ec.gc.ca/cmc/CMOI/product_guide/docs/tech_notes/technote_hrdps-north-200_e.pdf).

The technical specifications document for the HRDPS-N 2.0.0 is available [at this link](https://collaboration.cmc.ec.gc.ca/cmc/CMOI/product_guide/docs/tech_specifications/tech_specifications_HRDPS-NORTH_2.0.0_e.pdf).

## Tuesday June 28, 2022

See details [at this link](../changelog_multisystems_en.md).

## Wednesday December 1st, 2021

### Upgrade to Version 1.0.0 of the High Resolution Deterministic Prediction System North (HRDPS-N) at the Canadian Meteorological Centre

On Wednesday December 1st, 2021, starting with the 1200 UTC run, the Canadian Meteorological Centre (CMC) will retire the Canadian Arctic Prediction System ([CAPS](../nwp_caps/changelog_caps_en.md#wednesday-december-1st-2021)) and replace it with the High Resolution Deterministic Prediction System North (HRDPS-N) version 1.0.0.

The changes included in this upgrade are summarized as follows :

* Remove the ice-ocean coupling (CAPS was coupled).
* Migration to GEM version 5.1 with retro-physic.
* Model configuration similar to HRDPS-National.
* New geophysical fields.
* New version of the RDPS pilot model, [version 8.0.0](../nwp_rdps/changelog_rdps_en.md#wednesday-december-1st-2021).
