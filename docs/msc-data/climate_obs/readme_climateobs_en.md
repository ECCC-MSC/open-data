# Data and products of the climate data (normals, daily, hourly, monthly)

__Climate normals__

Climate Normals and Averages are used to summarize or describe the average climatic conditions of a particular location. At the completion of each decade, Environment and Climate Change Canada updates its Climate Normals for as many locations and as many climatic characteristics as possible. The Climate Normals, Averages and Extremes offered here are based on Canadian climate stations with at least 15 years of data between 1981 to 2010.

__Climate hourly__

Canadian hourly climate data are available for public access from the ECCC/MSC's National Climate Archive. These are surface weather stations that produce hourly meteorological observations, taken each hour of the day. Only a subset of the total stations found on Environment and Climate Change Canada’s Historical Climate Data Page is shown due to size limitations.The priorities for inclusion are as follows: stations in cities with populations of 10000+, stations that are Regional Basic Climatological Network status and stations with 30+ years of data.

__Climate daily__

Daily climate observations are derived from two sources of data. The first are Daily Climate Stations producing one or two observations per day of temperature, precipitation. The second are hourly stations that typically produce more weather elements e.g. wind or snow on ground. Only a subset of the total stations is shown due to size limitations. The criteria for station selection are listed as below. The priorities for inclusion are as follows: (1) Station is currently operational, (2) Stations with long periods of record, (3) Stations that are co-located with the categories above and supplement the period of record.

__Climate monthly__

A cross-country summary of the averages and extremes for the month, including precipitation totals, max-min temperatures, and degree days.  This data is available from stations that produce daily data.

## Access

### How to access the data

This data is available from the [MSC GeoMet](../../msc-geomet/readme_en.md) API / web services and on the [MSC Datamart](../../msc-datamart/readme_en.md) data server:
