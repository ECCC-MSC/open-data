# Data and Products of the Global Deterministic Storm Surge Prediction System (GDSPS)

The Global Deterministic storm Surge Prediction System (GDSPS) produces water level forecasts using a barotropic version of the NEMO ocean model (Wang et al. 2021). It provides 240 hours forecasts twice per day on a 1/12° resolution grid (3-9 km). The model is forced by the 10 meters winds and sea level pressure from the [Global Deterministic Prediction System (GDPS)](../nwp_gdps/readme_gdps_en.md).

During the post-processing phase, storm surge elevation is derived from total water level by harmonic analysis using t_tide (Pawlowicz et al., 2002).
