# Data and Products of the Global Ensemble Wave Prediction System (GEWPS)

The Global Ensemble Wave Prediction System (GEWPS) uses the third generation spectral wave model WaveWatch III® (WW3) to arrive at probabilistic predictions of wave elements from the current day out to 16 days into the future. The probabilistic predictions are based on 20 ensemble members and a control member that are forced by the 10 meters winds from the [Global Ensemble Prediction System (GEPS)](../nwp_geps/readme_geps_en.md). The GEPS forecast is a coupled atmosphere-ice-ocean model, its sea ice forecast is used by the GEWPS to dampen or suppress wave growth in areas covered respectively with 25% to 75% and more than 75% ice.

WW3 (WAVEWATCH III® Development Group, WW3DG 2019) is a third generation spectral wave prediction model that solves the evolution of the energy balance equation for the 2-D wave energy spectrum without any prior assumptions on the shape of the spectrum. The WW3 model has been implemented by a growing number of national operational forecasting centres over the last several years.

## Access

### How to access the data

The data are available on the [MSC Datamart](../../msc-datamart/readme_en.md) data server services:

* [Data available via the GeoMet-Weather API / geospatial web services](readme_gewps-geomet_en.md)
* [GRIB2 data available on the MSC Datamart](readme_gewps-datamart_en.md)

An [overview and examples to access and use the Meteorological Service of Canada's open data](../../usage/readme_en.md) is available.

### Licence

The [end-user licence for Environment and Climate Change Canada's data servers](../../licence/readme_en.md) specifies the conditions of use of this data.

### MSC Open Data Service Usage Policy

The [MSC Open Data Service Usage Policy](../../usage-policy/readme_en.md) determines what constitutes an acceptable use of MSC Open Data services and provides users best practices for optimal use.
