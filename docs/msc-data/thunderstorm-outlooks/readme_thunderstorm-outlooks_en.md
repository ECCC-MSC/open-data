# Thunderstorm outlooks data

The Thunderstorm Outlook data is a graphical or GeoJSON forecast product, which depicts the expected geographic areas of thunderstorms in Canada. Thunderstorm outlooks are issued by storm prediction centres across Canada during the convective season (May to October) each year. Both the graphical and GeoJSON products use the same source data that forecasters used in the prediction centres. Thunderstorm outlooks are issued once per day at around 12:00 pm regional local time. Since each office has their own standards of procedure, the forecasters are not required to send it at 12:00 pm. Nonetheless, the timestamp in the data is preconfigured to say it is issued at 12:00 pm in the GeoJSON product. Subsequent amendments to existing thunderstorm outlooks are issued on an as-needed basis during the day. Each amendment generates a new GeoJSON file and graphical product. The thunderstorm outlook may not be updated with active severe weather alerts. Users are asked to check with the latest watches and warnings for the most current conditions.
